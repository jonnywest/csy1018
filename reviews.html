              <h2>Code Academy Review from Skillcrush</h2>

                <h3>Code Academy</h3>

                  <p>I taught myself the basics of coding from a bunch of online tutorials that have long-since become obsolete and disappeared from the web. Back then, there weren’t really any interactive tutorials, just basic how-tos that you could try on your own. It was a whole lot of trial-and-error (and not a small amount of frustration)</p>
                 
                  <p>If you’ve done any research about learning how to code, then I’m sure you’ve come across Codecademy. As one of the largest online coding schools, it’s pretty hard not to run into some
                      mention of this organization.</p>

                  <p>Codecademy offers a lot of advantages over the way I first learned to code and I would have jumped at the chance to use a site like it when I was teaching myself.</p>
                  
                  <p>But that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re the best way to learn for everyone. To that end, I’ve put together three reasons you should use Codecademy, and four things you’ll want to look for when you get really serious about learning to code.


                  </p>

            <h2>Reasons to Learn Code with Codecademy</h2>    
                  
                    <p>There are some definite advantages to learning to code with Codecademy. They’ve helped more than 24 million students learn to code.
                       Here are three reasons you should definitely consider using Codecademy to learn coding skills, especially when you’re first starting out:</p>
                      
                <h3>1. It’s Free</h3>

                      <p> Let’s get this one out of the way first. Like the image above from Codeacademy’s homepage states, one of the biggest advantages they have over a lot of other companies that teach coding online is that it’s free.
                          You don’t have to sign up for a monthly subscription or pay by the class. For someone on a tight budget, that can be the deciding factor. And when a course is free, it automatically has a higher ROI (since the investment is just time, not time + money).
                          So obviously, if you’re just starting out learning to code and you’re not sure if it’s for you or not, then trying out some completely free classes is an enticing place to start.</p>
              
                <h3>2. It takes care of all the setup work for you</h3>

                      <p> One of the most annoyingly difficult things about learning to code is that oftentimes, the setup work is the hardest part. And that means that a lot of beginners never even have a fighting chance.
                          This isn’t the case when you’re learning frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But if you’ve ever tried to noodle around with backend languages like PHP, Ruby, or Python then YOU KNOW.
                          To even write a simple “Hello World” app on your local computer in Ruby you have to go through hours of computer set up installing Ruby, making sure all the “packages” are right, reconfiguring folder permissions, getting your server running, figuring out how to connect to your browser if you’re so inclined…
                          Just imagine hours of your day spent in the terminal trying to make sense of strange error messages you’ve never seen.
                          What Codecademy has done so brilliantly, is make it possible for you to learn the syntax of a programming language via an interactive experience in your web browser. No setup time, whatsoever.
                          Yes, this IS learning to code with training wheels, but when you’re a complete beginner training wheels are 100% appropriate.</p>

                <h3>3. Codecademy covers a TON of languages and topics</h3>

                      <p>Codecademy is nothing if not prolific, and one of their best features is just the breadth of their offerings. To date they have tutorials on HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Rails, AngularJS, ReactJS, Ruby, Command Line, Git, SQL, and Java.
                         More than enough to keep you busy for a while, and more than enough opportunities for you to determine whether you like this whole coding thing and want to give it a real go.</p>
