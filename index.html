        <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
    
            <p>The purpose of this site is to demonstrate my understanding of the code on which websites are built and to show that I can design and implement code to create user-friendly web pages that conform to modern day web development conventions. </p>
    
            <p>Web development is very new to me and has been quite daunting to jump into, but I have a keen interest in growing my skills and hope to be able to expand my knowledge in all facets of the industry. </p>
    
          <blockquote>
          "Web development has a very steep learning curve"
          </blockquote>
             
            <p>In this module I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS which has at times been overwhelming, web development has a very steep learning curve, but I have also learnt to appreciate how the internet works as well as the relevance and underlying infrastructure of the World Wide Web. </p>

          <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    
            <p>I originally studied creative media production at college after I had finished school. Here I learnt about wide variety of subjects from radio broadcasting, print layout and sound design to film development, motion graphics and animation.</p>
    
            <p>I then moved on to study games design where I was introduced to the basics of programming, world building and concept art. After completing my course, I spent a few years outside of education working full time before finally choosing to enrol on this computing degree to continue broadening my knowledge of all this technology.  </p>
    
          <h3>Other site content</h3>
    
            <p>In the navigation bar you will find access to 4 other web pages I have created. The first being reviews of some web development related recourses, sharing my experience with how they have helped me grow my skills.</p>
    
            <p>Second you will find a glossary showing definitions and explanations of web related terms. The third page will be a comparison of two web related jobs and my personal opinions on them, and then finally the tutorial page will display some web development techniques.</p>
